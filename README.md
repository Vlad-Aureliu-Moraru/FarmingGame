# üåæ GreenThumb Tycoon: The Genetic Harvest

A charming and intricate farming simulation game built with Java and Swing, where strategic planting, realistic economics, and groundbreaking genetic engineering collide\! Cultivate your farm, master the seasons, and breed the ultimate super-crops.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

### üöú Core Farming Loop

  * **Seasonal System:** Experience the dynamic cycle of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, each affecting crop growth, yields, and market demand. Plan your planting according to the season for optimal success\!
  * **Diverse Crops:** Plant a variety of staple crops, each with unique growth times and harvest values.
  * **Realistic Economy:** A dynamic marketplace dictates crop prices. Sell your harvest at the right time to maximize profits.
  * **Production Chains:** Go beyond raw crops\!
      * **Dairy:** Raise cows to produce milk, then process milk into valuable cheese.
      * **Vineyard:** Cultivate grapes and turn them into exquisite wine.
      * ...and many more production opportunities to discover\!

### üß¨ The Genetic Harvest: Unique Seed Breeding Mechanic

Our flagship feature\! Don't just plant seeds ‚Äì *engineer* them.

  * **Trait System:** Each seed isn't just a `Carrot` or `Potato`; it possesses hidden **traits** (e.g., `Fast-Growing`, `High-Yield`, `Drought-Resistant`, `Pest-Resistant`, `Colorful`).
  * **Seed Combination:** Experiment by combining existing seeds in your specialized "Genetic Lab."
      * When you combine two seeds, their traits have a chance to merge or even mutate, potentially creating a new, superior seed type.
      * Example: Combine a `Carrot (Fast-Growing)` with a `Carrot (High-Yield)` to try and get a `Carrot (Fast-Growing, High-Yield)`.
  * **Strategic Breeding:** Unlock rare and powerful trait combinations to grow crops that are resistant to challenges, grow faster, or yield significantly more, giving you a competitive edge in the market\!

## üìñ Game Basics

GreenThumb Tycoon operates as a turn-based simulation, where each "day" or "week" advances the game, crops grow, and market prices fluctuate. Players interact with the game through a clean and intuitive Swing-based graphical user interface.

### Getting Started:

1.  **Clear Land:** Prepare your plots for planting.
2.  **Buy Seeds:** Visit the general store to acquire initial seeds.
3.  **Plant:** Sow your seeds into the prepared land.
4.  **Wait:** Crops will grow over time, influenced by seasons.
5.  **Harvest:** Gather your mature crops.
6.  **Sell/Process:** Take your harvested goods to market or use them in production buildings to create value-added products.
7.  **Reinvest:** Use your earnings to expand your farm, buy new seeds, or upgrade your production facilities.
8.  **Experiment:** Head to the Genetic Lab to combine seeds and unlock new possibilities\!

## üóÑÔ∏è Game Data & Tables (Conceptual)

While implemented in Java/Swing, the game logic internally manages data that can be thought of in terms of these conceptual tables:

### `CROPS` Table

| Column      | Data Type | Description                              |
| :---------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `id`        | int       | Unique ID for each crop type (e.g., 1 for Carrot) |
| `name`      | String    | Display name (e.g., "Carrot", "Potato") |
| `baseGrowthTime` | int | Base days/turns to grow to maturity |
| `baseYield` | int       | Base number of units harvested per plot  |
| `baseSellPrice` | double    | Initial market value per unit            |
| `plantingSeason` | Enum/String | Which seasons it can be planted (e.g., "Spring,Summer") |

### `SEEDS` Table (User's Inventory)

| Column      | Data Type | Description                              |
| :---------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `seedId`    | int       | Unique ID for this specific seed (e.g., a specific instance of a carrot seed) |
| `cropTypeId` | int       | Foreign Key to `CROPS.id` (what kind of crop it is) |
| `trait1`    | String    | Trait associated with this seed (e.g., "Fast-Growing") |
| `trait2`    | String    | Second trait, if applicable (e.g., "High-Yield") |
| `trait3`    | String    | Third trait, if applicable |
| `rarity`    | Enum/Int  | Rarity level based on combined traits      |

### `PRODUCTION_CHAINS` Table (Conceptual)

| Column      | Data Type | Description                              |
| :---------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `productId` | int       | Unique ID for the produced item (e.g., 1 for Milk) |
| `productName` | String    | Display name (e.g., "Milk", "Cheese", "Wine") |
| `inputItem1` | int       | Foreign Key to `CROPS.id` or another `productId` (e.g., 1 for Milk) |
| `inputQuantity1` | int       | How much input is needed               |
| `outputItem` | int       | What is produced (e.g., 2 for Cheese)  |
| `outputQuantity` | int       | How much output is generated           |
| `processingTime` | int       | Time taken to process                  |
| `buildingRequired` | String    | Building needed (e.g., "Dairy", "Winery") |
